/*
Stacks
A stack is a data structure that uses a principle called Last-In-First-Out (LIFO), meaning that the last object added to the stack must be the first object removed from it.
       
At minimum, any stack should be able to perform the following three operations:

Peek: Return the object at the top of the stack (without removing it).
Push: Add an object passed as an argument to the top of the stack.
Pop: Remove the object at the top of the stack and return it.

In addition, it's often helpful to implement a method to check whether or not a stack is empty to ensure you are not attempting to perform peek or pop operations on an empty stack.
